/**
 * Log multiple method calls for an object.
 * Also populates an object with multiple data at the time of the call.
 *
 * @param {Object} baseObject - Object in which the method/function is.
 * For example to spy on the Date method `toLocaleDateString`, you will have to
 * set here `Date.prototype`.
 * @param {Array.<string>} methodNames - Every methods you want to spy on
 * @param {string} humanReadablePath - Path to the method. Used for logging
 * purposes.
 * For example `"Date.prototype"`, for spies of Date's methods.
 * @param {Object} logObject - Object where infos about the method calls will be
 * added.
 * The methods' name will be the key of the object.
 *
 * The values will be an array of object with the following properties:
 *
 *   - self {Object}: Reference to the baseObject argument.
 *
 *   - id {number}: a uniquely generated ascending ID for any stubbed
 *    property/methods with this library.
 *
 *   - date {number}: Timestamp at the time of the call.
 *
 *   - args {Array}: Array of arguments given to the function
 *
 *   - response {*}: Response of the function.
 *     The property is not defined if the function did not respond yet or was on
 *     error.
 *
 *   - responseDate {number}: Timestamp at the time of the response.
 *     The property is not defined if the function did not respond yet or was on
 *     error.
 *
 *   - error {*}: Error thrown by the function, if one.
 *     The property is not defined if the function did not throw.
 *
 *   - errorDate {number} Timestamp at the time of the error.
 *     The property is not defined if the function did not throw.
 *
 *   - responseResolved {*}: When the returned value (the response) is a promise
 *     and that promise resolved, this property contains the value emitted by
 *     the resolve. Else, that property is not set.
 *
 *   - responseResolvedDate {number}: When the returned value (the response) is
 *     a promise and that promise resolved, this property contains the date at
 *     which the promise resolved. Else, that property is not set.
 *
 *   - responseRejected {*}: When the returned value (the response) is a promise
 *     and that promise rejected, this property contains the error emitted by
 *     the reject. Else, that property is not set.
 *
 *   - responseRejectedDate {number}: When the returned value (the response) is
 *     a promise and that promise rejected, this property contains the date at
 *     which the promise rejected. Else, that property is not set.
 *
 * @returns {Function} - function which deactivates the spy when called.
